# Python GUI Frameworks

The following is a list of GUI framaeworks in Python with a little info about each. This list i ***not exhaustive***; however, I do *try* to add new frameworks when they seem to hit a large enough user base.

Many of the frameowkrs below I either have used in the past or are currently part of my toolkit. Some are just based on reseasrch and word of mouth.

If you have a suggestion for a framework that is missing or an error in a framework description, please let me know. I will try to add/update the description ASAP.
